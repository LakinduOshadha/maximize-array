# maximize-array

Given an array A[ ] of size n and a number k, you can be able to modify the array k number of times. 
Here modifying array means in each operation you can replace any array element A[i] by -A[i]. You 
need to perform this operation in such a way that after k operations, sum of the array must be 
maximum.
